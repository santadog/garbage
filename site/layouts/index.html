<h2 id="DP:"><a class="header-link" href="#DP:"></a>DP:</h2>
<p>A vain but unsuccessful filmmaker.  He flees to Canada from the UK thinking that he&#39;s being pursued by the banking authorities for a mysterious $3 million that suddenly appeared in his account there.  In Canada, he finds work as a documentarian for a private investigation firm who have tasked him with following KH around and documenting his life.  Still paranoid about the money, he sinks it into buying a shady propoganda graffiti company (idea: let&#39;s make DP think it&#39;s a waste disposal company called Garbage co.) whose operations he knows nothing of whatsoever.</p>
<h2 id="KH:"><a class="header-link" href="#KH:"></a>KH:</h2>
<p>Pretends he&#39;s a filmmaker.  KH is predominantly concerned with keeping up appearances so is constantly making up projects that he&#39;s working on in order to disguise the fact that his real job is writing propaganda around the city.  He receives calls at random intervals telling him to go to a location and graffiti a message there.  The private investigation company that has hired DP wants to get to the bottom of this and find out who it is that&#39;s running the show.  His situation is made more complicated when DP starts filming his life and, in order to convince DP that he himself is a filmmaker, begins making a documentary on his friend DK.</p>
<h2 id="DK:"><a class="header-link" href="#DK:"></a>DK:</h2>
<p>When his father, JK, dies, he stipulates in his last living will &amp; testament that DK would only receive his $3 million dollar fortune if he produces a work of astonishing artistic merit.  JK&#39;s accountant, Wolfgang Garbage, will oversee this transaction and deem what it is exactly that merits the title of an “astonishing work of art”.  DK thus arranges weekly meetings with Garbage where he brings in a piece of art for him to judge.  Due to the strange terms of his father&#39;s will, DK is unfocused creatively and tries his hand at a different medium every week.  On hearing that KH will be making a documentary on him, DK has the idea to try making one himself on DP hoping that this will finally be the work that&#39;ll impress Garbage (“Now that&#39;s Garbage!”) </p>
<h2 id="wolfgang-garbage:"><a class="header-link" href="#wolfgang-garbage:"></a>Wolfgang Garbage:</h2>
<p>A man amongst men.  Garbage has led an exciting, varied life and has achieved all of his aspirations.  He is an amalgam of great figures from history and fiction: the wit of Samuel JKson, the manliness of Hemingway, the romance of Byron, the mystery of Gatsby, etc.  Garbage has always lived with a quiet yearning and heartache for his best friend JK&#39;s wife _ .   JK and Garbage wrote “The Girl from Iwajima” - a sleeper hit in Japan but virtually unknown everywhere else.  Garbage never received much money from the royalties but instead went on to create a financial empire that spanned innumerable industries.  In his old age he maintains a quiet, lonesome life punctuated by DK&#39;s visits and thoughts of Mrs Kleiser.  He&#39;s never seen and is possibly a black guy.  Due to anti-German sentiment after WW2, Garbage is shy about using his given name but has no qualms with “Garbage”.</p>
<h2 id="JK-kleiser:"><a class="header-link" href="#JK-kleiser:"></a>JK:</h2>
<p>After recording “The Girl from Iwajima”, JK opted to receive $50 in cash in lieu of royalties.  Through Garbage&#39;s financial wizardry that money has grown over the years to become the cool three million dollars he&#39;s left in his will.  JK claims he wrote “The Girl from Iwajima” for the object of his affections, _ , who was swept off her feet by the powerful lyrical content and the emotive music of the song. </p>

<h1 id="the-story"><a class="header-link" href="#the-story"></a>THE STORY</h1>
<p>While on holiday in the UK two years ago, DK borrows £2 from DP to buy a can of coda soda (drink it now!).  It tastes delicious.  </p>
<p>Fast forward to the present day.  DP is broke, jobless and begins to tally the immediate sources of cash he can contact.  Upon finding the I.O.U., DP hassles DK to pay him the money (plus interest?).  Also broke and jobless, DK goes for his weekly meeting with Garbage.  They listen to some music, shoot the shit, smoke a couple of cigarettes, and Garbage throws a few sage-like words of wisdom.  He excuses himself to make a phone call while DK goes on Garbage&#39;s computer to check his emails.  A little perturbed by the urgency of DP&#39;s message, DK loads up the online banking and transfers the last $3 in his account to DP thinking that this is probably the correct rate of exchange.  Unbeknownst to DK, Garbage was already logged into the online banking and the money he transferred came from Garbage&#39;s account and not DK&#39;s.  Also, the balance was $3 million and not $3.  They say their goodbyes and DK departs.  </p>
<p>DP is puzzled by the $3 mil in his account and “Wolfgang Garbage” stated as the payee (think of a different payee name?).  His thoughts are a flurry of paranoia, excitement and worry for he still has no work and this money mistake might be taken away as swiftly as it was given.  He quickly withdraws the funds and contemplates what to do with them.  As luck would have it, a private investigation company contacts him at that very moment offering him some paid work.  The email, compounding DP&#39;s confusion, mentions that they are interested in documenting the life of KH, a struggling filmmaker and childhood friend of DP&#39;s.  They want DP to follow him everywhere he goes and document everything KH does then send them weekly 3 minute montages set to predetermined tracks.  “Well that&#39;s settled, I&#39;ll move to Canada!” DP thinks and refuses to doubt the luck he&#39;s been having or question the strangeness of the request in case such scrutiny might prove it all to be unreal.  As for the $3 million, he finds himself a little Garbage removal company listed on gumtree that he buys outright thinking that this will be a safe bet.  </p>
<p>DP calls KH and gives him the pitch.   KH, worried that DP might discover his secret employment claims that he&#39;s already making a doc on DK.  He then rushes to call DK and give him the exact same pitch.  DK, disheartened by his last meeting with Garbage, suddenly has the idea to make a documentary on DP in order to impress his godfather and win the contents of his father&#39;s will.  </p>

<p>When DP arrives in Canada he meets with the owner of Garbage co, Wolfgang Garbage, who explains the ins and outs of Garbage co.  To DP&#39;s embarrassment, the company actually has nothing to do with waste disposal but exists only to create porpaganda around the city.  Garbage gives him a number to call (KH&#39;s), some advice on what is and isn&#39;t good propaganda and a few decent locations to start out.<br>Garbage initially put Garbage co for sale when he noticed that the money had disappeared from JK&#39;s account </p>
<h1 id="notes:"><a class="header-link" href="#notes:"></a>NOTES:</h1>
<p>People making documentaries of eachother 
DP moves to canada from london to make a doc on KH
KH bullshits about all of what he&#39;s doing &amp; lies &amp; says he&#39;s making one on kleiser
KH calls kleiser &amp; gives him the exact same pitch that DP gave KH.  Word for word
when kleiser visited DP in england 2 years ago DP bought him a $3 soda.  DP asks for that money back.  Kleiser, filthy rich, sends him an e-transfer for $3 million accidentally from his accountant wolfgang garbage&#39;s account but never realises.  DP thinks he has received this money by accident and will be pursued by the law.  He flees to canada sinking the money into a documentary on himself filmed by kleiser while pretending its going towards the documentary on KH
KH: doesn&#39;t have much going on but is keen to lie about it.  Also into propoganda graffiti (garbage&#39;s company)
kleiser: is in a fake band.  The private investigation firm that is investigating the propoganda company can&#39;t pay DP because DK lost all his money.  They hire DP because it&#39;s easier to make a doc than it is to do pi spy camera work.  They also insist that DP sends them weekly synopses in 3 minute edits rather than just looking through all the footage.  They also occasionally request particular songs to montage over
the private investigation firm has hired DP to investigate the company KH works for (putting up propoganda posters) because they haven&#39;t paid their employees but they themselves don&#39;t pay DP
wolfgang garbage is KH&#39;s accountant &amp; originally a member of kleiser&#39;s dad&#39;s band that played &amp; wrote “the girl from iwajima” about kleiser&#39;s mom who he has always been in love with.  As it turned out, kleiser&#39;s dad took credit for writing the song and married kleiser&#39;s mom.  Kleiser&#39;s dad opted to get a $3 cheque for playing his guitar part and invested it wisely on garbage&#39;s advice.  Garbage opted for royalties but the song only made it big in japan.  He is bitter about this?  When kleiser&#39;s dad dies, wolfgang gives kleiser the money on the stiupulation that, according to his dad&#39;s will, he can&#39;t access the cash until he either creates a great album or documentary. 
Kleiser goes to wolfgang&#39;s weekly to play him a new album he&#39;s recorded to see if it&#39;s worth it
wolfgang forces himself to say that kleiser&#39;s album&#39;s terrible in order to delay him while he figures out what in the hell happened to the $3 mil that disappeared from kleiser&#39;s dad&#39;s account     </p>
